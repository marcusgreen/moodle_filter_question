# moodle_filter_question
Developing a simple text filter to add a question to Moodle text

Works with moodle_atto_question based on Justin Hunts moodle_atto_template codewhich adds a button to the Atto editor 
allowing a question to be inserted into text.  

The question id is slightly obfuscated and student cannot use the button.

Work in progress.
